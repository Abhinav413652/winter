# Project Name

Project Desktop Computer with DIY Monitor

## Summary

Me and my sister are going to build our first ever pc along with DIY Monitor. Building a PC will be a valuable learning experience that will teach us about computer hardware and software, as well as problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. We will learn about the different components that make up a computer, such as the processor, motherboard, memory, and storage, and how they work together to run a computer. We will also learn about different operating systems and how to install and configure them, as well as how to install and update software. In building a monitor, we will learn about the various electronic components that are used in a monitor, such as the display panel, circuit board, and power supply.. Overall, building a PC and a monitor will give us a solid understanding of the various hardware components that make up a computer and how they work together to run a system. And it will also be a fun and educational experience.

It is a team of two, me and my sister.

## Plan

We already have a laptop, so we are planning to take it's display out and complete the monitor. This DIY Monitor requires some more parts, but it will cross the budget. So, we will buy the control board and for the case we are still thinking about the best solution. 
When building a PC, it is important to carefully choose each component to ensure that it is compatible with the rest of the system and meets our needs. This is why we chose each part of the PC:
    Processor (CPU): I chose an Intel Core i5-12400 because it is a powerful and efficient processor that offers fast performance and good multitasking abilities.

    Motherboard: I chose an MSI PRO H610M-E because it is compatible with the Intel Core i5-12400 processor and offers good features such as DDR4 memory support.

    Memory (RAM): I chose XPG Adata 16GB DDR4-3200 because it is a high-quality RAM that is compatible with the motherboard and offers fast performance and stability.

    Storage: I chose Crucial 480GB SSD, this will provide fast boot times and quick load times for games and applications.

    Power Supply Unit (PSU): I chose a Ant Esports VS500L because it is a reliable power supply that can provide stable power to all the components and compatible with the overall power consumption of the build.

    Case: I chose a Zebronics Zeb-Cronus, it's a budget friendly case that offers good cable management and airflow.

Overall, the parts I chose for this build were selected to provide the good performance, stability and reliability. They are also compatible with each other and will provide the best experience for us.

We have divided the process and plan into two parts:-

THE PC:
  After purchasing all of the necessary components, we will do the following steps:

    1. Assemble the hardware: We will follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the processor, memory, storage, and other components in the case. Not only that we have also watched other youtube tutorials of building a PC. So assembling shouldn't be a problem.

    2. Install the operating system: We will insert the installation media (such as a DVD or USB drive) into the appropriate drive and boot from it to begin the installation process. 

    3. Connect peripherals: We will connect our keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals to the appropriate ports on the motherboard.

    4. Power on the PC: Double-check all of your connections, and then flip the switch on the power supply to turn on the PC. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup.

By following these steps, we will successfully build a PC using the components that we have purchased.

THE DIY MONITOR:
    After purchasing all of the necessary components, we will do the following steps:
        1. Connect the control board with the LCD Display.
        2. Place it in a case type thing.
        3. Manage the cables of the monitor.
        4. All Done!! We will check if it is working.
        
To complete this project in exactly 10 days :
    Day 1: Gather the tools required to build the monitor and the PC.
    Day 2: We will check if we have every components including tools.
    Day 3-5: We will build the PC. it will take 3 days as building a PC takes time and we don't want to mess things up.
    Day 6: We will deassemble the laptop and take it's Display out. Then we will assemble the Display and the control board together. 
    Day 7: Put the assembled thing in a case and manage the wiring so that it looks decent.
    Day 8: We will install an OS in our PC. (Will take some time)
    Day 9: We will install drivers and other required softwares.
    Day 10: We will finish everything by double checking everything and we will make sure everything is working fine.
