# Project Name

Project Desktop Computer + Hacking OS

## Summary

Recently, in the past years, I have been learning more about computers which has sparked my interest in this field. Me and my sister are going to build our first ever pc. On that PC we will develop our Hacking OS. It will be linux based Operating System. That PC will  help us learn many new things. Since our current laptop isn't a nice one, we are going to develop our OS in the pc we build. Even though I'll be the one guiding this project, I think this will be a super fun experience for both of us to further our knowledge and experience of PCs and OSs. I shall show my sister how a computer actully works.
By the way there are two persons in the project. The other member of this project is my sister.

## Plan

In the first day we shall build the pc and install Windows on it. Then we will develop our own Linux based operating system. This operating system will have almost everything Kali Linux has, and I shall change some things that I think that Kali should have. 
Once done, we will double check everything was executed properly. After this, we will test out the PC with our operating system! We are super excited to try to run various programs and tasks on it, and see how performance changes based on how we tweak the hardware and software. This PC will be something we can continue to learn from and grow with for many years.
