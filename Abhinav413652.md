# Project Name

Project Desktop Computer

## Summary

Me and my sister are going to build our first ever pc. Building a PC will be a valuable learning experience that will teach us about computer hardware and software, as well as problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. We will learn about the different components that make up a computer, such as the processor, motherboard, memory, and storage, and how they work together to run a computer. We will also learn about different operating systems and how to install and configure them, as well as how to install and update software. In addition, building a PC will give us hands-on experience with assembling and installing hardware, as well as troubleshooting and performing basic maintenance tasks. Overall, building a PC will give us a solid understanding of the various hardware components that make up a computer and how they work together to run a system. And it will also be a fun and educational experience.

It is a team of two, me and my sister.

## Plan

After purchasing all of the necessary components, we will do the following steps:

    1. Assemble the hardware: We will follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the processor, memory, storage, and other components in the case.          Not only that we have also watched other youtube tutorials of building a PC. So assembling shouldn't be a problem.

    2. Install the operating system: We will insert the installation media (such as a DVD or USB drive) into the appropriate drive and boot from it to            begin the installation process. 

    3. Connect peripherals: We will connect our keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals to the appropriate ports on the motherboard.

    4. Power on the PC: Double-check all of your connections, and then flip the switch on the power supply to turn on the PC. Follow the on-screen                instructions to complete the initial setup.

By following these steps, we will successfully build a PC using the components that we have purchased.
