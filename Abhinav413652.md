# Project Name

Project Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I am going to build a mechanical Keyboard. Not from scratch, as it will take some insane amount of expirience. I have been thinking about making this for almost a year now but being a student I don't have the funds to build it. just thibking of building it makes me super excited.

## Plan

Step 1: I would assemble the plate, the case and the pcb.
Step 2: Then I will install the stablizers and keyswitches
Step 3: Now, I will place the keycaps on the keyswitches and Done!!
I don't need any other specific tool except keycap and switch puller to replace something if needed.
